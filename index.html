					<p class="card-text">
						The website your on right now is my personal website, created from scratch in pure <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. A lot of people have a website of their own. Because I'm a creative person with self-learning capabilities, I wanted to make my own website. So a couple of years ago I picked up a study in HTML and CSS and here we are. My next step is to be able to build a website in PHP. I'm soon going to pick up a study in PHP(CodeIgniter). So keep an eye on my website.

					<h3 class="card-title">IoT, Getting your home smart.</h3>
					<p class="card-date">Published on: 20-02-2019</p>
					<p class="card-text">
						Internet of Things, I always had an interest in Smart Home Systems. Unfortunatly they all have one thing in common: They all need the internet, your personal information and their cloud storage. The thing is, when there is no internet connection at home, the whole system doesn't work. And what about your personal information? In my opinion this is not needed and it should function without it. That is my drive, my goal.
